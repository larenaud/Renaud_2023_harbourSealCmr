abstract = {In Denmark, harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, were first protected in 1977, and since then a number of seal reserves have been established in Danish waters. The effectiveness of these reserves to prevent human-induced disturbances to the seal population have, however, not been evaluated. To evaluate this, experimental disturbances were conducted in one of the most important seal reserves in Denmark (Anholt seal reserve). Specifically, the behavioural responses (alert distance, flight initiation distance, flee distances and flight duration) of harbour seals to approaching pedestrians and boats were studied. The project was conducted during three periods related to the breeding cycle of harbour seals. In all periods, harbour seals were alerted by boats at significantly greater distances compared with pedestrians (560-850m and 200-425m, respectively). Similar differences in the flight initiation distances were observed, 510-830m for boats and 165-260m for pedestrians. In most cases seals were alerted and began to flee when the approaching boat was outside the reserve, whereas seals did not respond to approaching pedestrians until after they had entered the reserve. Harbour seals exhibited weaker and shorter-lasting responses during the breeding season. They were more reluctant to flee and returned to the haul-out site immediately after being disturbed, in some cases even during the disturbance. This seasonal tolerance is most likely attributed to a trade-off between fleeing and nursing during the breeding season, and hence not an indication of habituation. Based on the results of this study it is suggested that the reserve boundaries on land be placed at least 425m from the haul-out area and the boundary at sea should extend to at least 850m from the haul-out area in order to secure adequate year-round protection from disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Many organisms are patchily distributed, with some patches occupied at high density, others at lower densities, and others not occupied. Estimation of overall abundance can be difficult and is inefficient via intensive approaches such as capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling. We propose a two-phase sampling scheme and model in a Bayesian framework to estimate abundance for patchily distributed populations. In the first phase, occupancy is estimated by binomial detection samples taken on all selected sites, where selection may be of all sites available, or a random sample of sites. Detection can be by visual surveys, detection of sign, physical captures, or other approach. At the second phase, if a detection threshold is achieved, CMR or other intensive sampling is conducted via standard procedures (grids or webs) to estimate abundance. Detection and CMR data are then used in a joint likelihood to model probability of detection in the occupancy sample via an abundance-detection model. CMR modeling is used to estimate abundance for the abundance-detection relationship, which in turn is used to predict abundance at the remaining sites, where only detection data are collected. We present a full Bayesian modeling treatment of this problem, in which posterior inference on abundance and other parameters (detection, capture probability) is obtained under a variety of assumptions about spatial and individual sources of heterogeneity. We apply the approach to abundance estimation for two species of voles (Microtus spp.) in Montana, USA. We also use a simulation study to evaluate the frequentist properties of our procedure given known patterns in abundance and detection among sites as well as design criteria. For most population characteristics and designs considered, bias and mean-square error (MSE) were low, and coverage of true parameter values by Bayesian credibility intervals was near nominal. Our two-phase, adaptive approach allows efficient estimation of abundance of rare and patchily distributed species and is particularly appropriate when sampling in all patches is impossible, but a global estimate of abundance is required. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Harbor seal breeding behavior and habitats constrain opportunities for individual-based studies, and no current estimates of both survival and fecundity exist for any of the populations studied worldwide. As a result, the drivers underlying the variable trends in abundance exhibited by harbor seal populations around the world remain uncertain. We developed an individual-based study of harbor seals in northeast Scotland, whereby data were collected during daily photo-identification surveys throughout the pupping seasons between 2006 and 2011. However, a consequence of observing seals remotely meant that information on sex, maturity-stage, or breeding status was not always available. To provide unbiased estimates of survival rates we conditioned initial release of individuals on the first time sex was known to estimate sex-specific survival rates, while a robust design multistate model accounting for uncertainty in breeding status was used to estimate reproductive rate of multiparous and ≥3-yr-old females. Survival rates were estimated at 0.95 (95{\%} CI = 0.91-0.97) for females and 0.92 (0.83-0.96) for males, while reproductive rate was estimated at 0.89 (0.75-0.95) for multiparous and 0.69 (0.64-0.74) for ≥3-yr-old females. Stage-based population modeling indicated that this population should be recovering, even under the current shooting quotas implemented by the recent management plan. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

We analysed nearly 10,000 abundance time series from over 2000 vertebrate species part of the Living Planet Database. We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We find that 15{\%} of populations declined, 18{\%} increased, and 67{\%} showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncover a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species' rarity and global-scale threats. Incorporation of the full spectrum of population change will improve conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity.},

abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This article provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).

abstract = {A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six vear period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation/soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained survey plots. Still, the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys.},

abstract = {An overview of physical oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2008 is presented. Air temperatures were close to normal when averaged from January to March, contributing to an ice cover volume that was also close to the climatological mean. Air temperatures were in general either normal or above normal for the remainder of the year. The monthly averaged freshwater runoff measured at Qu{\'{e}}bec City was normal overall in 2008, but consisted of above-average runoff in summer compensated later by lower runoff in the fall. The high summer runoff contributed to higher-than-normal stratification. Near-surface water temperatures were generally above normal throughout the Gulf for the months of May, July and November and were also above-normal on the Magdalen Shallows in June and in the northern Gulf from August to October. In August the northern parts of the Gulf saw positive anomalies while the southern parts experienced negative anomalies. This lead to the unusual occurrence that the waters around Prince Edward Island and in Northumberland Strait had higher temperature in July than in August 2008. On the Magdalen Shallows, a large area of the bottom was covered by water with temperatures {\textless} 0°C in September 2008, similar to the cold period observed in the 1990s and in contrast to conditions in September 2005, 2006 and 2007 when such cold waters were not observed. Maximum sea-ice volume within the Gulf and on the Scotian Shelf was 81 km³, a value now considered about normal using updated ice volume estimates for 1971-2000. Ice first appeared early in the season and stayed later than normal (later by about 8 days later on the Magdalen Shallows). Winter inflow of cold and saline water from the Labrador Shelf occupied the M{\'{e}}catina Trough from top to bottom in winter 2008. The spread of the intrusion was confined a bit closer to the coast compared to 2007 conditions, leading to an overall smaller volume of 1850 km³, which is similar to 2001 and 2006 observations. The winter cold mixed layer volume was 13 700 km³, a value higher than the 1996–2008 average by 0.8 SD, and corresponded to 41{\%} of the total water volume of the Gulf. The summer CIL (cold intermediate layer) index for 2008 was -0.70°C, comparable to the very cold conditions observed in 2003 and a large decrease (by 0.47°C) from the previous summer. Regional patterns of the August and September CIL show that the layers for T {\textless} 1°C and {\textless} 0°C were much thicker in most parts of the Gulf in 2008 than in 2007 and had a generally lower core temperature throughout the Gulf. In the Northern Gulf, the area covered by water of low temperature (from {\textless} -1°C through {\textless} 1°C) increased in August 2008 relative to August 2007. Temperatures in the water column in June 2008 were characterized by a very thick and cold CIL in most regions except the Estuary and by warm deep waters in the Estuary and the northwest Gulf. This overall pattern persisted in the August– September mean conditions. By October and into November, CIL conditions were still thick and cold, while waters above the CIL were anomalously warm. Overall, temperature and salinity were generally normal from 150 m to 300 m, with the exception of slightly lower than normal (by 0.6 SD) temperature at 150 m. Temperature and salinity in this depth range decreased for a second consecutive year. The near-normal Gulf-wide water temperatures at 300 m were composed of warmer waters in the Estuary, near-normal temperatures in the northwest and central, and colder waters flowing into the Gulf at Cabot Strait.},

abstract = {The statistical analysis of mark-recapture-recovery (MRR) data dates back to the 1960s, when the foundation was laid for stochastic models, fitted to data by the method of maximum likelihood. There have been a number of developments which have proved to be extremely influential. Two of these are: the extension of MRR data and modelling to multi-site inference, and the integrated modelling of single-site MRR and census data. The aim of this study is to unite these two independent research programs, in order to enable effective integrated analysis of multi-site MRR data and multi-site census data. Census data can be described by a state-space model, and the likelihood is formed using the Kalman filter. By making use of movement information provided by MRR data, it is possible to avoid flat likelihood surfaces, thus allowing estimation of site-dependent parameters. This increases the precision of dispersal parameters and allows estimation of parameters inestimable from MRR studies alone. This paper extends research within the area of integrated population analysis by developing methods for analysing multi-site census data coupled with multi-site capture recapture data. The methodology is explored using a simulated data set, the structure of which is motivated by a dataset of Great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis).},

abstract = {A model of grey seal population dynamics was fitted to pup production estimates for the Sable Island, Coastal Nova Scotia (CNS) and Gulf of St. Lawrence (Gulf) seal herds to provide estimates of the Canadian component of the Northwest Atlantic grey seal population from 1960-2014. As with the 2012 assessment, the model was fit to each of the three herds separately, resulting in separate predictions of pup production and total population size by estimating initial population size ($\alpha$), adult mortality (M) and environmental carrying capacity (K). Grey seal pup production in 2014 is estimated to be 93,000 (95{\%} CI=48,000 to 137,000) animals, with a total population of 505,000 (95{\%} CI=329,000 to 682,000). Sable Island production is estimated to account for about 77{\%} of the estimated total number of pups born in 2014. The estimated 2014 total population of each herd was 394,000 (95{\%} CI 238,000 to 546,000), 13,800 (95{\%} CI=9,300 to 27,300), and 98,000 (95{\%} CI=54,000-179,000), for the Sable, Coastal Nova Scotia and Gulf of St. Lawrence herds respectively. The model predicts that the overall population has continued to increase. To assess the impact of potential future removals on the population, the 2014 population was projected forward for 30 years under different harvest scenarios. To maintain an 80{\%} probability of staying above the precautionary reference level (N70) and assuming that young of the year (YOY) comprise 95{\%} of the catch, then harvests of 39,200 animals (Sable:33,000; CNS:1,200; Gulf:5,000) could be taken. If YOY comprise 90{\%} of the catch then the total harvest would be 36,600 (Sable=31,000; CNS: 1,100; Gulf: 4,500). If YOY comprise 70{\%} of the catch, then the total harvest would be 28,200 (Sable: 24,000; CNS: 700; Gulf: 3,500). Higher harvests are associated with increased risk of falling below the limit reference level and subsequent population collapse. Based on this assessment of the population, harvest levels at 50,000 grey seals or more, even with a harvest comprising 95{\%} pups, have a moderate to high probability of resulting in a population decline below N70 and N50. The risk increases with the level of harvest and with the percentage of the harvest of seal age 1 and older. Further work is needed to estimate age and sex-specific adult mortality and reproductive rates and to incorporate change in these rates into the herd-specific models, to determine the strength and nature of density-dependent changes in vital rates. Density- dependent changes in vital rates have a large impact on estimates of carrying capacity and the sustainability of future removals. Estimates of population size and trends will become increasingly uncertain until there is new information on pup production for each of the herds. A reassessment of the stock should be completed when new pup production estimates are available or be triggered by evidence of considerable changes in vital rates, including mass mortality of adult seals.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how studies to estimate the abundance of marine mammals have used the characteristics and behaviour of the target population to help determine the most appropriate method for any specific study. It also addresses how these studies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with ensuring that important assumptions of the method are not violated. Three basic methods used for estimating marine mammal abundance are described: extrapolating counts; mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data; and sightings surveys. Recent studies in the North Atlantic to estimate abundance include: harbour seals and bottlenose dolphins in the Moray Firth, Scotland; grey seals in the North Sea and the breeding population in Britain; North Atlantic humpback whales; and the NASS and SCANS sightings surveys for whales and small cetaceans in the North Atlantic and North Sea, respectively. The paper demonstrates the wide range of applicability of the available methods, the way that the example studies addressed and (in some cases) overcame potential problems, and the modification or extension of “standard” methodology to fit particular circumstances. {\textcopyright} 1995, Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abundance estimation is central to avian ecology. For replicated counts, Royle (2004) developed a model to estimate abundance adjusted for detectability. Hitherto, it was unknown whether the same covariate was allowed to affect both abundance and detectability. This situation was disconcerting, because relationships between abundance and such covariates describing, for example, habitat, lie at the heart of ecology. I test this by simulation and provide additional guidelines on the model as well as code to fit it in a Bayesian mode of analysis. I simulated 1,000 data sets mimicking the Swiss breeding-bird survey "Monitoring H{\"{a}}ufige Brutv{\"{o}}gel" (three surveys in each of 268 quadrats). Elevation affected abundance negatively and detectability positively, resulting in a hump-shaped relationship between counts and elevation. I used WinBUGS to fit the model and estimate parameters, including quadrat-specific abundance and total abundance, across all 268 quadrats. For every parameter, the model recovered estimates that showed no indication of bias. The mean error in the estimated total population size across all quadrats was only 2{\%}, whereas the summed maximum counts, a conventional abundance estimate, underestimated total population size by 43{\%}. In contrast to maximum counts, the binomial mixture model revealed the true negative relationship between abundance and elevation. This model is a promising new alternative to capture-recapture or distance sampling methods to estimate bird abundance free of distorting effects of detectability. It has perhaps the fewest requirements, needing neither individual identification nor distance information to "convert" simple counts ("relative abundance") into estimates of true abundance. It ought to be seriously considered in future bird-survey schemes. {\textcopyright} The American Ornithologists' Union, 2008.},

@article{Society2010,
abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture- recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This "analysis of variance" philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness-of-fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex-specific parameters, l},

abstract = {Previous studies of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina L., 1758) movements indicate that this species is relatively sedentary throughout the year. However, few investigations have examined their movements and seasonal distribution patterns in ice-covered areas. This study used spatial analysis of ice data and movement data from harbour seals collected via satellite (n = 7) and VHF radiotelemetry (n = 15) to explore this species' spatial use patterns in a seasonally ice-covered region, the St. Lawrence River estuary, Canada. When solid ice formed within the bays of the estuary, four of the seven satellite-tagged animals (all adult males) left their summer haul-out areas, migrating 266 ± 202 km (range 65-520 km) to over-wintering sites. The seals exhibited preference for areas of light to intermediate ice conditions during the winter months; at least six of the seven seals occupied areas with lighter ice conditions than those that prevailed generally in the study area. Evidence of high abundance of potential prey for harbour seals in the estuary during winter suggests that reduced availability of adequate food resources is not the primary factor which influences the movement and distribution patterns of harbour seals. Movement patterns observed during the ice-free period concur with previously reported harbour seal behaviour; the seals remained near the coast ({\textless}6.1-11.0 km from shore) in shallow water areas ({\textless}50 m deep in 100{\%} VHF and 90{\%} SLTDRs (satellite-linked time-depth recorders)) and travelled only short distances (15-45 km) from capture sites. None of the VHF- or satellite-tagged seals crossed the 350 m deep Laurentian channel, which suggests that this deep body of water might represent a physical barrier to this coastal population.},

Mark-recapture studies are a powerful tool for conservation managers, and can be used in any situation where animals can be marked (or otherwise identified) and detected later by capture or sighting. In addition to estimating population size and survival rates, mark-recapture methods can be used to evaluate impacts of threats on survival, record population trends, collect information for population viability analyses, set performance targets against which responses to management can be measured, and highlight areas where further research is necessary. This report has three main sections. The first section introduces the basic principles of mark-recapture methodology that conservation managers need to understand to design effective mark-recapture studies. In the second section, specific guidelines for estimating abundance, survival and population growth rates are provided. We show which methods are appropriate for different situations, how field studies should be designed to avoid violating assumptions of mark-recapture methods, and how to get started on analysing the data. In the final section, we review a case study involving long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus), and use this to illustrate some problems that may be encountered in mark-recapture studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Shark-inflicted mortality on harbour seals Phoca vitulina on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, was studied from 1980 to 1997, based on carcasses washed up on shore. During this period, pup production declined dramatically from over 600 in 1989 to 40 in 1997. Between 1980 and 1992, pup deaths only were recorded, and only during the May?June pupping period, while deaths in all age groups were recorded year-round between 1993 and 1997; 458 pups, 23 juveniles and 241 adults were found. Shark-inflicted mortality in pups, as a proportion of total production, was under 10{\%} during 1980?93, roughly 25{\%} in 1994?95, and increased to 45{\%} in 1996. Shark-inflicted mortality occurred in all months except December, January and February, with c. 80{\%} of the pups killed during the pupping period, and 97{\%} of the adults killed outside the pupping period. The decline in pup production was not only a result of reduced recruitment owing to pup mortality. A greater proportion of reproductive females than males was killed. We estimate that shark-inflicted mortality on pups and adult females reduced pup production on Sable Island by 43 to 154 pups annually between 1993 and 1997. Our results indicate that sharks are having an impact on Sable Island harbour seals, possibly to the extent of limiting population growth, or contributing to the observed population decline. Potential reasons for this increased mortality are discussed.},

abstract = {1. Binomial mixture models use repeated count data to estimate abundance. They are becoming increasingly popular because they provide a simple and cost-effective way to account for imperfect detection. However, these models assume that individuals are detected independently of each other. This assumption may often be violated in the field. For instance, manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) may surface in turbid water (i.e. become available for detection during aerial surveys) in a correlated manner (i.e. in groups). However, correlated behaviour, affecting the non-independence of individual detections, may also be relevant in other systems (e.g. correlated patterns of singing in birds and amphibians). 2.We extend binomial mixture models to account for correlated behaviour and therefore to account for non-independent detection of individuals. We simulated correlated behaviour using beta-binomial random variables. Our approach can be used to simultaneously estimate abundance, detection probability and a correlation parameter. 3.Fitting binomial mixture models to data that followed a beta-binomial distribution resulted in an overestimation of abundance even for moderate levels of correlation. In contrast, the beta-binomial mixture model performed considerably better in our simulation scenarios. We also present a goodness-of-fit procedure to evaluate the fit of beta-binomial mixture models. 4.We illustrate our approach by fitting both binomial and beta-binomial mixture models to aerial survey data of manatees in Florida. We found that the binomial mixture model did not fit the data, whereas there was no evidence of lack of fit for the beta-binomial mixture model. This example helps illustrate the importance of using simulations and assessing goodness-of-fit when analysing ecological data with N-mixture models. Indeed, both the simulations and the goodness-of-fit procedure highlighted the limitations of the standard binomial mixture model for aerial manatee surveys. 5.Overestimation of abundance by binomial mixture models owing to non-independent detections is problematic for ecological studies, but also for conservation. For example, in the case of endangered species, it could lead to inappropriate management decisions, such as downlisting. These issues will be increasingly relevant as more ecologists apply flexible N-mixture models to ecological data. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Harbour seal (Phoca vitulina concolor) haul-out behaviour was studied during the spring and summer of two consecutive years to examine whether local environmental conditions influenced the number of seals on land in predictable ways. The study was conducted in an estuarine area with a large tidal amplitude. Tidal level and time of day were previously reported to be the predominant factors influencing the haul-out pattern in this area. Few of the meteorological variables recorded in the present study influenced seal haul-out numbers significantly and no single factor predominated. Increased numbers of seals on land were associatd with weather conditions leading to warmer air temperatures, less cloud and less precipitation. This behaviour might be associated with moulting. High waves offshore were also related to more seals hauded out; the seals may be hauling out to meet a rest requirement, the number of seals on land was diminished by increased surf splash at the haul-out site, precipitation and human-related disturbance. Some differences in haul-out behaviour between the pupping and post-pupping period were noted. Regression analysis followed by a prediction experiment helped assess those variables considered important in influencing seal numbers on land.},

abstract = {Much of animal ecology is devoted to studies of abundance and occurrence of species, based on surveys of spatially referenced sample units. These surveys frequently yield sparse counts that are contaminated by imperfect detection, making direct inference about abundance or occurrence based on observational data infeasible. This article describes a flexible hierarchical modeling framework for estimation and inference about animal abundance and occurrence from survey data that are subject to imperfect detection. Within this framework, we specify models of abundance and detectability of animals at the level of the local populations defined by the sample units. Information at the level of the local population is aggregated by specifying models that describe variation in abundance and detection among sites. We describe likelihood-based and Bayesian methods for estimation and inference under the resulting hierarchical model. We provide two examples of the application of hierarchical models to animal survey data, the first based on removal counts of stream fish and the second based on avian quadrat counts. For both examples, we provide a Bayesian analysis of the models using the software WinBUGS.},

abstract = {As part of the development of a management program for Nile crocodiles in Lake Nasser, Egypt, we used a dependent double-observer sampling protocol with multiple observers to compute estimates of population size. To analyze the data, we developed a hierarchical model that allowed us to assess variation in detection probabilities among observers and survey dates, as well as account for variation in crocodile abundance among sites and habitats. We conducted surveys from July 2008-June 2009 in 15 areas of Lake Nasser that were representative of 3 main habitat categories. During these surveys, we sampled 1,086 km of lake shore wherein we detected 386 crocodiles. Analysis of the data revealed significant variability in both inter- and intra-observer detection probabilities. Our raw encounter rate was 0.355 crocodiles/km. When we accounted for observer effects and habitat, we estimated a surface population abundance of 2,581 (2,239-2,987, 95{\%} credible intervals) crocodiles in Lake Nasser. Our results underscore the importance of well-trained, experienced monitoring personnel in order to decrease heterogeneity in intra-observer detection probability and to better detect changes in the population based on survey indices. This study will assist the Egyptian government establish a monitoring program as an integral part of future crocodile harvest activities in Lake Nasser. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{Smout2020,
abstract = {The trade-off between survival and reproduction in resource-limited iteroparous animals can result in some individuals missing some breeding opportunities. In practice, even with the best observation regimes, deciding whether ‘missed' years represent real pauses in breeding or failures to detect breeding can be difficult, posing problems for the estimation of individual reproductive output and overall population fecundity. We corrected fecundity estimates by determining whether breeding had occurred in skipped years, using long-term capture–recapture observation datasets with parallel longitudinal mass measurements, based on informative underlying relationships between individuals' mass, breeding status and environmental drivers in a capital breeding phocid, the grey seal. Bayesian modelling considered interacting processes jointly: temporal changes in a phenotypic covariate (mass); relationship of mass to breeding probability; effects of maternal breeding state and mark type on resighting. Full reproductive histories were imputed, with the status of unobserved animals estimated as breeding or non-breeding, accounting for local environmental variation. Overall fecundity was then derived for Scottish breeding colonies with contrasting pup production trends. Maternal mass affected breeding likelihood. Mothers with low body mass at the end of breeding were less likely to bear a pup the following year. Successive breeding episodes incurred a cost in reduced body mass which was more pronounced for North Rona, Outer Hebrides (NR) mothers. Skipping breeding increased subsequent pupping probability substantially for low mass females. Poor environmental conditions were associated with declines in breeding probability at both colonies. Seal mass gain between breeding seasons was (a) negatively associated with lagged North Atlantic Oscillation for seals at NR and (b) positively associated with an index of seal prey (Ammodytes spp) abundance at Isle of May, Firth of Forth (IM). Overall fecundity was marginally greater at IM (increasing/stable pup production) than at NR (decreasing). No effects of mass were detected on maternal survival. Skipping breeding in female grey seals appears to be an individual mass-dependent constraint moderated by previous reproductive output and local environmental conditions. Different demographic trends at breeding colonies were consistent with the fecundities estimated using this method, which is general and adaptable to other situations.},

abstract = {1. Harbour seals Phoca vitulina in eastern England were heavily exploited in the 1960s and 1970s, and affected by phocine distemper virus (PDV) epidemics in 1988 and 2002. Information on their historical and current status is required for their management. To maximize the effectiveness of limited population survey effort we need to both estimate and minimize error. 2. Presented here are data from annual aerial surveys of the population. Sporadic, synoptic surveys in The Wash, England, were used with more frequent counts of subpopulations in the Moray Firth, Scotland, to determine optimum timing of surveys. 3. We developed models that explicitly account for variability in both observation and population growth processes to show that the proportion of animals observed is much more variable than the annual growth rates. The latter can therefore be treated as constant within each period, and estimated along with the epidemic mortalities during the study and the precision of the survey results. 4. The Wash population increased at around 3{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} per annum (pa) [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 2{\textperiodcentered}1-4{\textperiodcentered}1] between 1973 and 1988. It fell by approximately 52{\%} (95{\%} CI 44-59) as a result of the 1988 PDV epidemic, and subsequently increased at 5{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} pa (95{\%} CI 4{\textperiodcentered}8-6{\textperiodcentered}7). These growth rates were below those reported for European mainland populations, but showed no indication of density-dependent effects. 5. The recurrence of PDV in 2002 caused approximately 22{\%} mortality (95{\%} CI 9-33), significantly less than the 1988 epidemic and less than half that in European mainland populations in 2002. 6. Synthesis and applications. Combining sparse, systematic survey data with sporadic counts produced robust estimates of growth rates and epidemic mortality. The results indicate the value of even limited and sporadic survey effort for monitoring populations. The study has highlighted significant differences in both population dynamics and the severity of disease events between English and European harbour seal populations. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},
